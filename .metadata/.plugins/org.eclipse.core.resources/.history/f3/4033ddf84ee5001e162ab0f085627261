<!-- In practice, using a PUBLIC declaration with a formal public identifier is preferred because it allows XML parsers to locate the DTD(Document Type Definition) file even if the system hosting the XML document is not connected to the internet. The SYSTEM declaration, on the other hand, relies on the availability of the DTD file at a specific URL.   -->
