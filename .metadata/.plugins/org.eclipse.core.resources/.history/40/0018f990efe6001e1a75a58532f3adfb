@Entity - use to mark any class as Entity

@Table  - use to change the table details

@Id  - use to mark column as id(primary key)

@GeneratedValue - hibernate will automatically generate values for that using an internal sequence.Therefore, we don't have to set it manually.

@Column - Can be used to specify column mappings. For eg, to change column name in the associated table with dataabse

@Transient - This tells hibernate not to save the field

@Temporal - @Temporal over a date field tells hibernate the format in which the date needs to be saved

@Lob - It tells hibernate that this is a large object, not a simple object.

@OneToOne, @OneToMany , @ManyToOne, @JoinColumn etc...
